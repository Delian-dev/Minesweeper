This is a copy of the game Minesweeper. The java was made with a lot of help from a tutorial since I started learning it about 2 weeks ago. The html and css are mostly my ideas
!!! To be able to play this it is necessary to open the folder with the help of a local webserver ( such as Web Server for Chrome or Polymer serve) !!!
